# Rellax Demo
I saw this parallax javascript library: https://github.com/dixonandmoe/rellax and decided to try it on a simple page.

## Installation
* run `npm install`

## Usage

* `npm start` to start Webpack in watch mode - will recompile when you change a file.
* `npm run build` to start Webpack in build mode - will create public files in dist folder
